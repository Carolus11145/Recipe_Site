        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the soaked barley and wheat in a pan with double water quantity. If you choose
                to use a pressure cooker it will take around half an hour. Otherwise, it
                will take roughly an hour.
            </li>
            <li>Churn the wheat and barley with a blender until it gains a paste-like consistency.
                Add a little water if you feel it is too thick. 
            </li>
            <li>Mix together the ginger-garlic paste, salt and crushed cumin and fennel seeds in a
                seperate pan. Shred the chicken and put it to one side.
            </li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken and the paste to the wheat-barley mixture along with the chicken stock.
                Mix well and allow it to cook for another 15 minutes. You can add chat masala and lemon juice.
            </li>
            <li>Here you can opt to temper with only oil or with Haleem masala. Top the Harees with haleem masala,
                then heat oil in a pan and pour it over the Harees. Close the lid so the smell is absorbed.
                
            </li>
            <li>The dish is officially ready to serve. Garnish with fried onions, coriander and a table spoon of ghee.</li>
